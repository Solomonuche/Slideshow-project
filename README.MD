# Create an Image slider with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 

## Zuri Front-end Development Task.

I am currently learning Front-end development with the Zuri. This task is to Create a Carousel/Slideshow with 6 different images of  your choice. 

Ensure the following:
The images are properly styled.
Directional icons (previous and next Icons ) are shown on the images only when hovered
On clicking the icons, it should show the next/previous image. 
When the next icon on the last image is clicked, it should show the first image.
When the previous icon on the first image is clicked, it should show the last image.
